feature scaling.
initialized the classifiers:Implement the following five classification algorithms: 1. Logistic Regression 2. Decision Tree Classifier 3. Random Forest Classifier 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) 5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 
evaluate model on basis of accuracy
compare model with help of bar plot (accuracy vs diffrent algorithm)-to find which model is best and worst
